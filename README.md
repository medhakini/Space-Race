# Space Race
Multi-player web application created as Google CSSI Final Project

## Game Play
Features: multiplayer, single player (gesture based and arrow based)

Using the multiplayer feature allows you to play Space Race across multiple computers! The waiting room allows for 2 players per room, and the server can host multiple rooms. Use the arrow keys to move, and get 5 points to win!

The single player feature allows for an arrow based version in which the rocket is controlled by arrow keys, and a gesture based, where the user can rely on gestures to control the rocket. 

## Building Space Race
On the front-end,

- Edit `views/index.html` to change the content of the webpage and imported libraries
- `public/script.js` is the javacript that runs when you load the webpage

On the back-end,

- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
